## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct provides guidance on participation in open source communities, outlines the process for reporting unacceptable behavior, and documents consequenes for unacceptable behavior. As an organization and community, we are committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone.

### Our Pledge:

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our communities a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy communities.

We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community. If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so. We seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community.

## Standards:

As contributors, members, or bystanders we each individually have the responsibility to behave professionally and respectfully at all times. We are kind to others and careful in the words that we choose.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our communities include, but are not limited to:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive and actionable feedback
- Accepting accountability and responsibility, apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Prioritizing the health and well-being of the overall community over individual actions

Examples of unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- The use of violent threats, abusive, insulting, discriminatory, or derogatory content
- Offensive comments related to age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Public or private harassment including, but not limited to, intimidation, stalking, repeated inappropriate social contact, and unwanted communication. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- Berating others because you are not getting what you want. It is not acceptable to demand immediate resolution of your issues, to derail other issues “just to make your point”, or to use personal insults when you feel like you are being ignored.
- Publishing private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

**Enforcement Responsibilities:**

Community maintainers of this project are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community maintainers as defined above have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, decline, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the community. Examples of representing our community include using official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
